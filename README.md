# LINKED LIST

This project implements a simple linked list in C with various operations including insertion, deletion, counting elements, and printing elements.

## WHAT IS A LINKED LIST?

A linked list is a linear data structure where elements are stored in nodes, and each node points to the next node in the sequence. Unlike arrays, linked lists do not store elements in contiguous memory locations. Instead, each node contains:

- Data: The value or the information stored in the node.
- Pointer: A reference to the next node in the list.

#### There are different types of linked lists:

`Singly Linked List: Each node points to the next node. The last node points to null (or nullptr in C), indicating the end of the list.`
`Doubly Linked List: Each node has two pointers: one pointing to the next node and one pointing to the previous node.`
`Circular Linked List: The last node points back to the first node, forming a circle.`

## FEATURES

- Insert at the Beginning: Adds a new element at the start of the linked list.
- Insert at the End: Adds a new element at the end of the linked list.
- Remove from the Beginning: Removes the first element of the linked list.
- Remove from the End: Removes the last element of the linked list.
- Count Elements: Counts the number of elements in the linked list.
- Print Elements: Prints all the elements in the linked list.
